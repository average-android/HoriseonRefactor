# HoriseonRefactor

Hello!
This repository contains the refactored code for the Horiseon website, complete with proper semantic elements, sequential headings, alt tags, and working CSS to boot. 

To those grading: I apologize for the lack of commits initially- I was toying with the code a lot and not saving, and I didn't make an effort to actually create a repository until the work was mostly done. This probably won't happen again, so don't worry. I was just getting the hang of pushing the files and connecting my repository to my computer.

Cheers!
